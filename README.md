Convert a video to a comic book :) ( Cool... isn`t it )


--It was a hack-day project, done by me ( Jay Chawda ) and Vijayaraghvan.  ( We won prize for it too ). Basically, we brew some scripts, wrote some tools ,and  some messing around with OpenCV, image-processing concepts. End result was a system what takes in a video file ( any format ) and a subtitle file(.srt) and gives out a PDF..

--Currently, I have uploaded the final output generated of one episode of "The Big Bang Theory", and a small, non-tech overview of our project..

--I will be uploading source codes soon.. 


Stay tuned ..
